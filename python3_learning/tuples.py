#####Python Tuples
#Tuples are immutable. Cannot add, delete, replace, reorder elements.
# t1 = ()
# t2 = (1, 2, 3)
# t3 = tuple([1, 11, 111])
# t4 = tuple("welcome")
# print(t1, t2, t3, t4)



#####Tuples functions
# t1 = (1, 21, 5, 58, 9, 10, 11)
# print(min(t1))
# print(max(t1))
# print(sum(t1))
# print(len(t1))



#####Iterating through tuples
# t1 = (1, 21, 5, 58, 9, 10, 11)
# for i in t1:
#     print(i)



#####Slicing tuples
# t1 = (1, 21, 5, 58, 9, 10, 11)
# print(t1[:2])



#####in and not in operator
t1 = (1, 21, 5, 58, 9, 10, 11)
print(1 in t1)
print(101 not in t1)
